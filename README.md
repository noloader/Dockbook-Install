DockBook Install
================

This GitHub provides instructions to setup DocBook on Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04 and 20.04 with Apache FOP 2.8.

The instructions include the steps to install packages such as `docbook`, `docbook-xsl`, `docbook-xsl-doc-pdf` and `xsltproc`. The instructions also cover installation of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Development Kit (JDK), if needed.

The instructions are in `docbook-install.pdf`. Once DocBook is setup just run `make-book.sh` to create the book.
